Human social networks are inherently multiplex, comprising overlapping layers of relationships. Different layers not only have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also interact to form complex and interdependent pathways for contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network‑based interventions. We introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, network torque. We collected complete sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and implemented exogenous interventions to study behavioral contagion on multiplex human networks. In a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types—such as close friendships—uniquely enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate “chupones” and enhance attitudes regarding fathers’ involvement in postpartum care.
