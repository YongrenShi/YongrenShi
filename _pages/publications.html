Shi, Yongren, Edo Airoldi, and Nicholas Christakis. “Multiplex Networks Provide Structural Pathways for Behavioral Contagion in Rural Social Networks” 

abstract: Human social networks are inherently multiplex, comprising overlapping layers of relationships. Different layers not only have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also interact to form complex and interdependent pathways for contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network‑based interventions. We introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, network torque. We collected complete sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and implemented exogenous interventions to study behavioral contagion on multiplex human networks. In a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types—such as close friendships—uniquely enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate “chupones” and enhance attitudes regarding fathers’ involvement in postpartum care.



Shi, Yongren and Kevin Kiley. “Culture from Conversation: How Conversation Transition Structures Shape Online Communities” 

abstract: How does a group with no formal leadership or individual identity develop a distinct and potentially extreme culture? We argue that cultural change can emerge from interactional structure, specifically from shifted expectations about how one kind of talk follows another, a concept we call “conversational transition structures” (CTSs). Using data from the now-banned Reddit forum r/incels, we show how shifts in conversation patterns increasingly redirected conversations about everyday topics toward fatalistic and conflict-oriented topics, with replies aligning with these dominant structures receiving increasingly more positive evaluation from forum insiders over time. Simulated projection demonstrates that shifts in CTSs account for much of the forum’s cultural transformation. These findings highlight a core mechanism of cultural organization, structure in conversation, and suggest that shared response patterns can stabilize group discourse and generate recognizable expressive styles even in the absence of social structure or identity.
